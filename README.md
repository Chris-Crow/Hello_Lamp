# Hello_Lamp

## Intro
These Hello_Lamps were my way of keeping touch with family while I was out of the country.  Couple a Wemos D1, some LED strip and an ikea lamp fixture and you have a perfectly capable lamp to show those you care about you are thinking of them.

### Hardware

- Wemos D1 Mini
- 5V WS2812 Led Strip
- Generic Capacitive Touch Sensor

### Software 

Nothing special for this, utilising the Arduino IDE I made use of the following libraries: 
- [pubsubclient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient,"knolleary/pubsubclient")
- [Adafruit_NeoPixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel,"adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel")
- [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager,"tzapu/WiFiManager")
